            I've never really thought about front-end development as a medium of
            communication until I my intructor spoke about it today. I always
            thought of it as just code, nothing more nothing less.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content-p">
            But when you frame it as a medium communication well it's pretty
            darn important.If we can't commumnicate our message through our UI
            in a logical, clear and orginazied way our users may not even stick
            around to see what else we have regardless of how good it is.
          </p>
          <p class="article-content-p">
            Its a reminder that there is no one part of software development
            that's more important than another.

                As we learn to craft systems rather than pages, we must invest
                effort into shaping these often missed states of design and
                create with a component lifecycle that can support everyone.
