        <p class="article-content">
          I've never really thought about front-end development as a medium of communication until I my intructor spoke about it today. I always thought of it as some kind of means to an end. I have to build this UI for the sake of building a UI. Because it just needs to get done.
        </p>

        <p class="article-content">
          But when you frame it as a medium communication well it's pretty darn important. If we can't commumnicate our message through our UI in a logical, clear and orginazied our users may not stick around to see what else there is to explore.
        </p>

        <p class="article-content">
          Its a reminder that there is no one part of software development that's more important than another. We have to pay equal attention to all parts of the system we are designing and understand that any weak link the system will prevent the system from working effectively.
